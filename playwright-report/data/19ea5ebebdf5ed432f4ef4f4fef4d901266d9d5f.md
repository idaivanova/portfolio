          - generic [ref=e85]:
            - paragraph [ref=e86]: Through an in-depth UX research and analysis process, I identified critical gaps in the user journey and touch points. B2B users hesitated due to unclear pricing and fragmented value communication. B2C users struggled to differentiate between models and often preferred direct support (via phone calls and less often via mail) instead of exploring the catalog independently. Analytics revealed high mobile traffic but low engagement, signaling an urgent need to support both quick entry and deeper desktop research.

            - paragraph [ref=e128]: While my initial focus was on the sitemap and product page flows, it became clear that the brand identity and overall interface design needed significant attention. For users to confidently explore, compare, and select the right desk - without resorting to direct contact - the interface had to provide clarity, guidance, and visual credibility. At the same time, the brand needed to convey trust and stability to match the quality of the offering.

            - paragraph [ref=e167]: The landing pages seen on a side are supplementary page meaning that the user will be exposed to them only in a context specific situation. For example, if the user is looking for a bundle order to set up an office environment of 10 desk, then service such as assembling is not only nice to have option but even a necessity in most of the cases. Same goes for making an order with the incentive on making more purchases in future. In B2B world that appears to be quite common - a company purchases 10 ergonomic desks and when there is demand for more to be upgraded from normal to ergonomic desks in future, a loyalty or bonus program becomes quite relevant.
